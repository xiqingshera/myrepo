I have made two maps of Guangzhou,which is a city in southern China.The GUI-based one is made in ArcGIS,which showed the population density in different regions.The code-based one is made in R language by ggplot,maptools and mapproj packages,which shows the total population of different governance regions of Guangzhou.
Here are my maps,the first one is the ArcGIS map, the second one is the R map.

                                    "A Comparasion between ArcGIS and R Language"
  In the progress of this assignment, I have well understood the convenience of GUI-based mapping software while making analysis and the great reproducibility of code-based mapping language while sharing the map and show the workflow of mapping.
  I will talk about the different between the two software in the aspect of work-flow and character.
  First, the great difference in the work-flow must be addressed. The GUI-based mapping software has a visually directed work-flow while the code-based mapping language has a data-based work-flow. While using the GUI-based mapping software like ArcGIS, I can analyze the data from different sources and use a lot of familiar tools to merge, join or sum up the data. When I want to make a specific operation on the map, I will first look at the vision of the map then consider the target map I want to get. Then, based on the difference between the two maps, I will consider a geo-tool in ArcGIS toolbox. After choosing a right tool, I will cautiously drag or select the data together into the tool and run the tool. Finally, a target map will emerge on my screen or I will fail the operation with a red sign on the bottom of my screen. This is absolutely a kind of work-flow based on the target and vision. The operation and the tools used will be decided by the visual effect. However, when I draw a map using R language, the most important thing I will and MUST keep in mind is the structure of the data. Because I have used matlab for years to make transportation analysis, I was quite uncomfortable with the data in R language. R language uses data frame as the most common data structure. When I want to draw a map, I will first think about the data structure of the raw data, then the structure of the data I want to visualize. The function merge or join will be used to merge the data, then the function ggplot will be used to visualize the data. To sum up, the data is the most important thing while drawing a map with R language.
  Second, the difference in the character of the ArcGIS and R language is also interesting. In my opinion, ArcGIS is a good tool to make geographic analysis while R is a great tool to make dynamic maps with data from different sources. In ArcGIS, it is very easy to join or calculate the data based on the geographic position and the information in the data. However, it is nearly impossible to make analysis based on the geographic position of the data in R language. In ArcGIS, the map is static and output into JPEG or pdf, it is easy to make a static beautiful map in ArcGIS. However, the map cannot change itself without the operation by yourself. It is quite different in R language. The map in R language can be quite dynamic. After the change of the data, the only thing you should do is run the code again and enjoy the new map with all new features in it. Further on, it is possible to make a map with interactive features with R language. You can make a dynamic and interactive map with R language and share it with a HTMl file.
  Finally, I would like to say, GUI-based mapping software like ArcGIS is more convenient while making complex beautiful static map, however, code-based language like R is easier to reproduce, share and make interactions.
